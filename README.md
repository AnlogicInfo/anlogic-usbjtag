firmware.fwb, The firmware, you HAVE TO use dfu-utils or anlogic dfu tool to flash into a chip which already contains a bootloader.

flash.bin, The firmware and the bootloader. You can use STVP or stm32flash to flash it into a blank chip, and it does work, not require you use dfu-utils to flash again.
